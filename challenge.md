Firstly, there was quite a lot of flexbox layout involved in this design, especially when it comes to the table rows, but it was overall manageable. Secondly, it was a challenge to make sure that all the relevant information is presented clearly to the user on such a small screen, and it was also another challenge to make sure that out-of-service buses are also indicated immediately so users will not spend time waiting for buses that they mistook as operational.
